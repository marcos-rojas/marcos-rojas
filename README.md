I'm a mechatronic engineer :mortar_board: with focus on data analytics and data science. I really like programming :computer:, reading and making data tell its own story :loudspeaker:. I also really love the feeling of being a detective whose cases can be in every phase of the industry in all corner of the organization.
As an engineer, I enjoy learning new tools as well as new approaches to solve a problem. Critical thinking :mag_right: as well as technical mindset :bulb: allow me to guide the steps an analysis will take. 
### Talking about personal stuff:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying and practicing deep learning on Udemy as well as Japanese :u6708:
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data science project all over the world
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to robotics or programming, I'm happy to help
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Github or **[Gmail](rojas.marcos@pucp.edu.pe)**
### Skills I would like to boost:
- :pencil2: Writing is powerful, I think it can be more helpful that reading when learning something
- :rocket: I'm currently learning more about Data Structures and Algorithms to optimize the way I think when programming

** :octocat: Currently looking for a job entry role as Data Scientist **

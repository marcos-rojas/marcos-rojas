### Hello, I'm [Marcos](https://marcos-rojas.github.io/portfolio/) :wave:
Happy to see you here ![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=rojas-marcos)

I'm a mechatronic engineer :mortar_board: with focus on web development. I like programming :computer:, reading and making apps :loudspeaker:. As an engineer, I enjoy learning new tools as well as new approaches to solve a problem with a critical thinking mindset.
### Talking about personal stuff:
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying and practicing React JS :rainbow: as well as Japanese :u6708:
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking forward to collaborate on web dev projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to robotics or programming, I'm happy to help
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Github or **[Gmail](rojas.marcos@pucp.edu.pe)**
### Skills I would like to boost:
- :pencil2: Teaching is powerful, I think it can be more helpful that reading when learning something
- :musical_score: I really love music which peace my mind. Last time : [Danse Macabre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YyknBTm_YyM)
 ### :octocat: Currently looking for a entry role job as Front-End Developer
